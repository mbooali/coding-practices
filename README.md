# Coding Practices

In this repository I have basically put my coding practices in different languages. Mostly tried to use Python, C++. In future I would like to translate them to Go. It would be fun.

At the moment I would push the data structure implementations to one folder and programming challenges to other folder. On each folder, you can find same code in one or multiple programming languages.
